Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [1,3,5,7,20]), write a program that prints the average of the values in the array.
Again you're not to do this by using of any of the pre-built functions in Javascript.
Again iterate through each number in the array and update the 'average' as the program retrieves each number in the array.
