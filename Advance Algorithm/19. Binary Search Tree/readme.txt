In computer science, a binary search tree (BST),
sometimes also called an ordered or sorted binary tree,
is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:[1]

    The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
    There must be no duplicate nodes.

Build a binary search tree with the following methods:

add, contains, remove, toArray, toString, size, traverse
