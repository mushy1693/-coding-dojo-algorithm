Create a function called split2 that does exactly what the split function does in Javascript.
Do this without using split function but only using if/else, for loops, basic array manipulation with pop, push, length/count.

Example

Split a string into an array of substrings:

var str = "How are you doing today?";
var res = split2(" ", str);

The result of res will be an array with the values:

How,are,you,doing,today?
